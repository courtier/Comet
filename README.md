Compilation of races against other snipers: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLieMpvHP8JIPpxRydYkRjhzqAzV_pSzJy

Discord: Y291cnRpZXIjNTQ0Mw==

### Note
You will not be able to compete with big/better snipers unless you have lots of accounts.

Microsoft migration changed authentication method so MS accounts do not work with this.

I suggest you don't use this unless you are able to download Java 15 on your own.

## Features
1. Sniper (Turbo and Normal)
2. Security questions (format: "username:password:sec1:sec2:sec3" in accounts.txt)
5. Discord webhooks (custom, format: "webhook url;name;profile picture url" in webhooks.txt, name and picture are optional)
6. Skin change upon snipe
7. Various other settings as seen in config.txt
9. Some other cosmetic things

## Installation

1. Install Java 15, and put it in path
2. Then download the jar file from here https://github.com/derin-n/Comet/releases/ or Discord idk where the most recent jar will be.
3. Put the Jar in a new folder and make a new .bat file (in case of Windows). Make a .sh if you use a mac. 
4. Type: java -jar Comet<version>.jar (e.g. java -jar Comet.1.1.jar) in the .bat or .sh file (depends on the OS)
5. Make a file called accounts.txt and put in your account(s) in that file, formatted like this: email:password
6. OPTIONAL: Make a file called webhooks.txt and put your Discord webhook url(s) in the file, and the bot will notify any snipes through that webhook
7. On your first time running Comet, choose the option that says "Retrieve default config" and change config.txt values however you want.
